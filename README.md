#House Heating System using High Chart #
Basic application for one person living in a house with four separate rooms (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, livingroom) for winter. Made for weekdays when he/she wakes up, goes to work, return back, have dinner, and then sleep.
Assumptions made:
    1. The day starts at 0.00 and ends at 23:00. 6.00 represents time between 6:00 - 6.59.
    2. The temperature settings are 0 for heating is OFF, 100 for heating is ON (the person preferred temperature), and 50 for bearable temperate for few minutes (going quickly to bathroom during night)  
    3. The person has to sleep on or before 23:00
